# VerifAI
## Project Summary  

**VerifAI** is an open-source AI-driven tool designed to enhance academic integrity by verifying research citations. It analyzes a paper’s references to determine:  

✅ Whether the paper actually cites the referenced sources  
✅ If the referenced sources are real, AI-generated, or retracted  
✅ The validity of claims attributed to each reference  

### Why VerifAI?  
- **Free & Open-Source** – Unlike paid alternatives like CiteSure, VerifAI is accessible to everyone  
- **Retracted Paper Detection** – Flags references that have been formally retracted  
- **AI-Generated Content Identification** – Identifies citations that may be hallucinated by AI models  
- **Condensed Source Suggestion** – Recommends compact sources when multiple references are similar  
- **Academic Integrity Support** – A comprehensive tool for students, researchers, and journal editors  

### Potential Use Cases  
 **Graduate Students** – Easily verify bibliography accuracy for theses and dissertations  
 **Academic Researchers** – Ensure research papers meet citation standards before submission  
 **Professors & Instructors** – Cross-check references in student work for accuracy
